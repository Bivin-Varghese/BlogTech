      "content": "WhatsApp is receiving an update that adds 'Companion' mode  to the app. The new version 23.10.76 for iOS is also available in India, and users can update the app from the Apple App Store. The Companion mode will let users run WhatsApp on up to four iPhones simultaneously. The benefit of the feature is that users can use a single account on multiple iPhones at the same time. WhatsApp companion mode is already available on Android smartphones. For the feature to work, open WhatsApp on your secondary device and click on the three dots on the top right. Select Link device and you will see a QR code. On the primary device, go to Settings and select Linked Devices. You will need to give access to your camera (if not already given) to scan the QR code on the secondary device. Following this, WhatsApp will sync between the two devices. Notably, the secondary device can function even if the primary iPhone does not have the internet.  Users can make WhatsApp video/audio calls with secondary iPhones and enjoy other features. Some chats may not fully load and old call logs may not be available either. WhatsApp parent firm Meta promises the same end-to-end security protocol to safeguard users' privacy Apart from the companion mode, the new update also brings new features. The official changelog notes that WhatsApp users can now save important messages for later when using Disappearing Messages. To use the feature, simply long-press on a message and choose Keep to save the text for later. Moreover, the app is adding new text overlay tools for Status, including updated fonts and background colours. "
