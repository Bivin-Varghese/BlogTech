      "content": " WhatsApp is working on several new features, but two of them are major updates that will arrive soon. One of them is the ability to add usernames and hide your phone number on he app. The other one is screen sharing during video calls. The messaging platform recently added three big updates, including a Chat Lock feature, Edit button, and an option to use one WhatsApp account on multiple mobile phones. Let’s now take a look at 2 new major features that are coming to the messaging app.\n\nWhatsApp to let you hide phone numbers\nAccording to screenshots shared by WaBetaInfo, WhatsApp is working on a feature that will let you add a username to your account. The platform will give you the option to hide phone numbers, and all users will only be able to see only usernames. With the introduction of this feature, WhatsApp could also let anyone reach other people by entering a username within the app without revealing their phone numbers.\n\nWith this, users will be able to add an additional layer of security to their accounts. The feature will have a dedicated section in WhatsApp Settings > Profile. Currently, the new feature to add a WhatsApp username is under development and it will be released for more beta testers in a future update. Once everything works smoothly, the same will also be rolled out for those who are on the stable version of the app.\n\nWhatsApp to let you share screen\nYes, you read that right. WhatsApp is planning to add a new option to let you share your phone’s screen during video calls. The app is used by billions of users for both messaging and calling. The addition of screen sharing in video calls would likely cut off a lot of its rivals like Google Meet. WhatsApp currently supports up to 32 people. This feature is available for Android beta testers of the app and it will likely be released for the stable version in the coming weeks or months.\n\nLatest features added to WhatsApp for everyone\nWhatsApp has released a new Chat Lock feature for everyone. The name is pretty much self-explanatory. People will be able to add a lock to their super personal chats, so that no one is able to access them even if you hand over your phone to anyone else. The good thing is the new feature automatically hides the contents of that chat in notifications as well and so, your privacy is protected.\n\nWhatsApp has finally launched a new Edit button feature for everyone. Users will get a 15-minute window to make any changes to the wrong messages that they might have sent to anyone. This is a very useful feature as one now won’t be required to delete full messages as the edit button will let you correct sentences or words that you think were not correct initially."

      "id": "The Most Popular Front-end Frameworks in 2023",
      "author": "Arun Gopan",
      "content": "Developing what the users see on their screens is the role of a front-end web developer. Unarguably, front-end developers worldwide are trying to use the best front-end frameworks to provide the best user experience.\n\nThe digital market has become a competitive space since many businesses are joining the league each year. There was a time when only a few players developed their digital platforms and started offering their products and services. With the technology boom, organizations understood that online interaction and presence is the future.\n\nToday, the end-user is the focus, and it is crucial to render a great experience to retain customers in the long run. The first step in this process is developing a user interface that is seamless and appealing. Indeed it means developers dealing with complex operations and functions. But ultimately, the efforts result in profitable business growth.\n\nTech giants have been extensively using frontend frameworks. As the name suggests, frontend refers to how an application or website looks to the user. The content arrangement, typography, graphics, etc., all contribute to the visual appeal of the platform. Thus, the frontend framework can be defined as the tools used to build the visual aspect website or application. Some of the major tasks associated with this framework are:\n● Managing AJAX requests\n● Correlating data with the document object model\n● Outlining file structures\n● Styling and designing of app or website components\nhurdles\n\nWhat are Frontend Frameworks?\nBefore discussing the top Front-end Frameworks, let’s understand what Front-end frameworks are. To understand a Front end framework, we need to know what the front-end is. The front-end of a website or application is the stuff visible to the user on the website. The graphics, typography, and arrangement of these two are what contribute. In addition, it includes building user-friendly interfaces and efficiently presenting the data from the back end to a user.\n\nThus, a Front-end Framework is a platform/tool to build the front end of your website. Some of the tasks one can perform using a Front-end Framework are – the management of AJAX requests, associating data with The Document object Model (DOM) elements, defining a file structure, and styling of components on the website or application.\n\nBest front-end Frameworks in 2023\nWhen it comes to Frontend Frameworks for web development, there will always be debates regarding which among them is the best. However, after researching the recent studies and surveys about the most popular Front-end frameworks, we have come up with an explicit list of the best front-end frameworks for you. This list is prepared as per the surveys conducted by Github stars.\n\nWith immense development in technology, there are several frameworks available that developers can work with. Each framework offers a unique feature, and thus, it becomes crucial for the developer to choose the right one. Since every business has a different goal, the web or app should be developed in correspondence to the same.\n\nThe ranking of these Frontend Frameworks for web development decides as per the following three crucial factors –\n\nType of applications you can create with it\nOne of the most important deciding factors in choosing a front-end framework is what type of application or website you want to create. Whether it is a large-scale application or a small-scale web application, the choice of a framework varies a lot. The most popular front-end frameworks for large-scale applications are – vue.js, react.js, angular, and smaller web applications – jquery and Backbone Js.\n\nThe ease of learning and using\nWith the growing popularity of the digital world, more and more new developers are emerging each passing day. Today, people believe in learning skills that are easy to learn and can help them earn a good living. Therefore, newly emerging front-end developers prefer learning the frameworks that are easy to learn and use and have all the features needed. For example – Reactjs, Vuejs, and Backbonejs are some of the simplest and easiest frameworks to learn than the complex frameworks like angular.\nReact\nConsidering how easy it is to learn and how much money a ReactJs Front-end developer makes, ReactJs could easily steal the number one spot for the best Front-end Framework. Now an open-source framework, React was originally developed by Facebook’s team.\nFacebook was an emerging app and needed constant additions and improvements, making it hard to fix and maintain the coding part. React allowed them to make changes to the code easily. The unique thing about react is the Virtual Document Object Model (DOM) with exceptional functionality.\n\nAdvantages\n\nReact is easy to learn and use.\nReact allows you to reuse an already built component in your code. This way, it’s easier to collaborate and use these components in other parts of the application.\nUse of its virtual DOM allows a seamless performance and ensures that even high-load applications have fast rendering.\nIncreased productivity and maintenance. New changes in the application can be easily made.\nIt has a browser extension named React Developer Tools, which allows them to make detailed observations of their components and make them better.\nLimitations\n\nIn the initial phases of learning React, it can be difficult for the developers to understand the concepts of JSX.\nReactJS is used for developing only the UI part of the application. Therefore, to get complete development tools, you will have to rely on other technologies.\nAs the components can be easily updated at high speed, it isn’t easy to maintain proper documentation.\nApplications\nReact is mostly used for developing single-page applications. However, it is a framework specifically used for User Interface development. It comes in quite handy when you require building an interactive interface for an application within a limited time because you can reuse the components in this framework.\n\nWhere can you not use React?\nJSX is pretty tough when it comes to learning. Therefore, if you are a new developer, it’s recommended not to use React. Secondly, the knowledge of JavaScript is necessary for using React. In case you don’t know JavaScript, React is not the go-to option for you.\n\nAngular\nThe only of the many Front-end Frameworks in 2023 based on TypeScript, Angular makes its spot on this list. Angular was initially released in the year 2010 by Google as AngularJs. The now known version of the Framework (Angular 2+) was developed and deployed in 2016, keeping in mind the need for improved technology to overcome the hurdles faced by the conventional Frameworks. Similar to ReactJs, it is an open-source platform used to develop user interfaces on the front end.\nAlso read:- React vs Angular: Which Is A Better JavaScript Framework?\n\nThe one main difference between React and Angular is that Angular has a two-way binding feature. The presence of this feature allows the integration of any changes made in the model with the view. This way, a developer would see what changes they are making in the application and how it looks in real-time.\n\nAngular usually deals with the development of mobile and web applications. Not just that, but one can easily build both single and multi-page web applications. Due to its various features, Angular is opted by some of the biggest companies in the world, including Microsoft Office, BMW, Forbes, Gmail, and Upwork.\n\nAlthough Angular has better features when compared to React, it is not easy to learn. The framework is a bit complex and thus takes time to excel at.\n\nRead more:- Features & Differences Of Angular 9 and Angular 8\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe in-built functionality of this framework allows real-time model-view synchronization and makes it easier to make any changes to the application.\nThe presence of Directives allows the developers to play around with the Document Object Model (DOM) and create rich content using HTML.\nDependency injectors allow the developers to decouple interdependent components of code and reuse these components however they need.\nAngular gained popularity among the developers since it was launched. Today, there’s a big community of web developers who use Angular. A developer can easily seek help from this community if he faces an issue.\nLimitations\n\nThe wide variety of features and built-in functionalities make Angular a very complex language to learn.\nDynamic applications can lag sometimes and may not perform upto the mark.\nApplications\nAngular is the go-to option for most enterprise-based and dynamic web applications due to its two-way data binding that allows browser-based applications to augment.\n\nWhen Can you not use Angular?\nAngular is the complete dynamic solution as a Framework. Thus, if you want to build small-scale web applications, you may not want to opt for angular because you would not utilize its resources to the best. It would merely be a misuse of time and resources. Furthermore, if you are a new developer with a small team, you should avoid using the complex Frameworks like Angular.\n\nVueJs\nThe developers of VueJs have combined the existing Front-end Frameworks’ best features to deploy a simple and straightforward framework.\nFirstly, it is not complex like Angular, which makes it easy to learn and use. Secondly, it is much smaller in size and similar to Angular, offers two-way binding, Visual DOM, and component-based programming.\n\nVueJs is a framework that allows you to build both dynamic and small web applications with ease. However, despite being versatile, it is not yet popular among big-scale companies. This is because most large-scale companies still trust Angular for enterprise-based web applications. Some of the companies that use VueJs are Alibaba, 9gag, and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso read:- Best JavaScript Frameworks Recommended By JS Communities\n\nAdvantages\n\nAvailability of detailed documentation for learners.\nSupports the development of both complex dynamic applications and simpler smaller applications.\nThe syntax of this framework is very simple and thus easier to work with.\nPresence of a virtual DOM.\nLimitations\n\nVue, being in high demand in China, has many of its documentation built-in Chinese, which creates a language barrier for people accessing these documents outside of China.\nVueJs is still in its growing stages and thus does not have a large community.\nVueJs provides a wide range of features, but it’s not as big as React or Angular.\nApplications –\nVueJs is suggested to be used for projects that need greater flexibility. You can design everything from scratch and therefore allows designing dynamic applications with more ease.\n\nWhen not to use –\nDespite having a wide range of features, VueJs is still not successful in creating stable components. Another reason why you wouldn’t want to opt for VueJs is if you’re looking for a community where you can seek help if you face any hurdles."

      "content": "“Intelligence” is a God-gifted in-born virtue, especially in the super living-being called Homo sapiens (human being). It is the ability to learn/understand/acquire and apply one’s knowledge and skills as per the need of the moment/situation, be it brand new experience or already experienced one.\n\nThere are generally four types of “intelligence” common among the human beings as classified by the learned social scientists.\n\nSuch as: 1) IQ (Intelligence Quotient) 2) EQ (Emotional Quotient) 3) SQ (Social Quotient) and 4) AQ (Adversity Quotient).\n\n“IQ measures a person’s level of comprehension, i.e. tests a person’s ability to solve mathematical equations, memorising things, identify patterns and recall lessons”.\n\n“EQ refers to one’s ability to manage emotions, ability to understand and self-manage own feelings in positive ways to communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges, manage conflict and relieve stress.”\n\n“SQ refers to one’s ability to interact and communicate with others with empathy and assertiveness. It is a person’s ability to build a network of friends and maintain it over a long period of time.”\n\n“AQ refers to one’s ability to overcome challenges or adversity. When faced with troubles, this quotient considers who will give up, who will abandon their family, and who will contemplate suicide.”\n\nToday, with the advancement of science and technology, we have churned out “Artificial Intelligence (AI) which is “the basis for mimicking human intelligence processes through the creation and application of algorithms built into a dynamic computing environment.”\n\nIn a nutshell, “AI is trying to make computers think and act like humans.”\n\nWhile the term “AI” was coined in 1955 by John McCarthy, its beginning in 1956 paved the path for a new field of study and data science like “machine learning”, “deep learning”, “predictive & prescriptive analytics”.\n\nIT experts contend, “Computers are extremely efficient at calculating complex combinations and permutations to arrive at the best decision. AI is the foundational future of business decision making.”\n\nAI is also used today for “financial services fraud detection”, “retail purchase predictions”, and “online customer support interactions” called “Virtual Customer Assistance (VCA)” that responds to customer inquiries outside of human reactions.\n\nThe three key components needed: Computational Systems, Data and Data Management, and Advanced AI Algorithms Code for real achievements.\n\nExperts opine, “The more humanlike the desired outcome, the more data and processing power required.”\n\nAI is claimed helping industries in financial services, healthcare, automotive accelerate innovation, improved customer experience and above all reduces costs.\n\nNevertheless, “Science is a good servant, but a bad master” if goes beyond one’s clutches or misused or at the worst case develops technical glitches.\n\nEven though Google is very popular and blindly banked upon, the million dollar question lurks, “Is Google Guru better than Human Guru (teacher)?\n\nSame is the case with AI when “To Err is Human” is an age-old adage.\n\nThus, great English bard-cum-playwright William Shakespeare has well-said, “All’s well that ends well.”",

      "id": "How the Coming CPU War Is Likely To Play Out",
      "content": "If you look ahead on the roadmap to 2024, some impressive parts are coming from AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, targeting your PC that will change dramatically how these machines work.\n\nThis period is when hardware tries to catch up with the generative AI trend, and our PCs, tablets, and smartphones get smarter. But the real battle will be on PC CPUs which will increasingly get GPU and NPU capability — or VPU if we are talking about Intel — and as a result, performance and battery life should get huge bumps.\n\nGiven that these products will all be relatively new, their real benefits may not show up until 2025 as software evolves to take advantage of the latest hardware features. Let me lay out the battlefield for you and showcase that this fight will also open the door to new competitors like Nvidia that will step in to shift the marketplace.\n\nWe’ll close with my Product of the Week, a new workstation from HP that is the quietest I’ve ever tested.\n\nIt’s Intel’s Market To Lose\nIntel is the established vendor when it comes to mobile parts, so this war is on Intel’s traditional battlefield.\n\nThe product to watch is code-named Lunar Lake, arguably the most significant advancement Intel has ever made for a PC platform. On paper, this product should be more than good enough if it weren’t for the fact that Intel has undergone both layoffs and a salary adjustment where employees get reduced income. These two events are typically very damaging to morale and productivity and could put the timely release of this product, due in 2024, in question.\n\nIn addition, the revolutionary nature of this product will require a more robust campaign than Intel has recently executed. It continues to struggle to retain a chief marketing officer at a time when it will need a Dennis Carter-level of execution. Intel has not adequately supported CMOs since early this century, which adds concerns about the company’s ability to execute this launch fully.\n\nFortunately for Intel, it is the entrenched vendor in mobile parts. However, AMD has been making inroads, so a failure to execute here could give AMD and Qualcomm a huge boost in their efforts to dethrone Intel.\n\nAMD\nRecently, AMD has been firing on all cylinders. When it says it’s going to do something, it happens.\n\nAMD is expected to have a similar product to Intel’s Lunar Lake in the market in 2024 and has indicated it will have pivoted sharply to generative AI tools to create it.\n\nThe use of AI in this context is doubly important and may indicate some risk because AI continues to be a driving force, and a vendor actively using the technology should have better insights on how to optimize hardware for it. Also, we expect AI to be a significant sales driver for this entire PC hardware class.\nAgain, however, as with Intel, the exposure for AMD is marketing. Never a marketing powerhouse, AMD is like most engineering-driven companies in that it underfunds marketing, which means it may not get the credit for its advancements that it otherwise would.\n\nWith the right marketing campaign and an Intel miss (this last is likely, as noted above), AMD could take a major laptop share. But this potential may remain unmet without the interest or ability to fund and run such a campaign. Should Intel miss its deadlines, AMD is the most likely to benefit, given that it will already be in the market with a similar alternative.\n\nQualcomm\nQualcomm is in a unique position due to its dominance in the smartphone space. It is developing a fresh new PC processor design co-developed with Nuvia, which Qualcomm acquired in 2021 for $1.4 billion. There is increased interest in integrating smartphones with PCs, and nobody should be able to do that better than a vendor aggressively working to improve both platforms.\n\nHowever, to make this work, Qualcomm’s marketing requirements are significantly higher than those of Intel or AMD due to its negligible presence in the PC market. Qualcomm recently lost one of its early design wins, the HP Folio, to Intel, even though the resulting product only offered about a third of the battery life compared to earlier Snapdragon-based alternatives.\n\nQualcomm’s higher marketing requirement is because it is the most different. Both Intel and AMD are x86-based, while Qualcomm is uniquely ARM-based. ARM isn’t pleased with Qualcomm or its effort because it feels that Qualcomm should pay it more for a PC platform license. The litigation between ARM and Qualcomm has the potential to damage the initiative significantly, and Qualcomm is already in the weakest position of the three vendors mentioned so far.\n\nThis brings us to…\n\nNvidia\nNvidia’s plan to buy ARM fell through, leaving the company high and dry on the CPU side but continuing to execute well with its GPU products. Nvidia also licenses from ARM, but, unlike Qualcomm, due to its vastly smaller commitment to that company, it could switch to RISC-V, an equivalent product to ARM that appears to lack the ARM financial troubles left over from the failed acquisition.\n\nNvidia is a wild card here but has more AI presence than the other three vendors combined, so whatever they do will likely significantly impact the marketplace. Its latest RTX 4060 card is an impressive showcase of the level of performance a vendor can bring to the market for a small amount of money.\n\nWith the right combination of CPU, GPU, and NPU (neural processing unit), Nvidia could move in and steal much of this market from the other players. We don’t know what Nvidia will replace ARM with as it moves ever closer to becoming a solution vendor.\n\nWrapping Up\n2025 will be the year of massive laptop chip wars with Intel entrenched but weakened, AMD performing well but continuing to underfund marketing, and Qualcomm not yet in the market with its next-generation PC part and appearing to underfund its marketing.\n\nIf any of these vendors can step up and meet their timeline objectives and find a way to fund demand generation marketing for new parts, they could own or take this market.\n\nWhile I’ve listed Nvidia as a wildcard, RISC-V is a wildcard also and could be used by Qualcomm, Nvidia, or some new arriving vendor to pivot the market from x86 to a more forward-looking AI-centric alternative.\n\nThe good news for all of us is that in 2024, at least by the end of it, we should see laptops with 20+ hours of battery life without sacrificing performance. I hope we’ll also see some new designs that better embrace sustainability and reduce electronic waste.",

      "content": "For years now, we have been spectators to the widespread commendation of blockchain technology as the bedrock of future innovations, a technology imbued with the power to disrupt the status quo across various sectors. However, let’s be frank and challenge this perception. A clear-eyed examination of the landscape reveals an array of substantial challenges that may potentially hinder blockchain from living up to the hitherto championed expectations.\n\nChallenges\n\nFirstly, let us examine the issue of Security. At its core, blockchain operates as a distributed ledger, inherently free from the control of a singular entity. This decentralised nature is one of blockchain’s most lauded features; it amplifies security by rendering a systemic attack by hackers impractical, if not downright impossible, given that any manipulations must be simultaneously orchestrated across a multitude of data points in the network. However, this technological utopia has, on occasion, suffered significant breaches. Recall the catastrophic pilferage involving the DAO in 2016, resulting in a loss of Ethereum to the tune of $50 million. An incident such as this underscores the imminent security risks that taint blockchain’s seemingly impregnable facade.\n\nNext, we grapple with the issue of Complexity. Blockchain technology is fundamentally intricate, and herein lies a sizeable challenge for businesses as it can be difficult for businesses to find developers who are familiar with blockchain technology. The labyrinthine nature of blockchain often means a dearth of skilled developers who are adequately versed with this technology, complicating the task of finding the right expertise to successfully implement blockchain initiatives.\n\nThirdly, let’s address the elephant in the room, the Lack of Adoption. Despite the buzz around blockchain technology, businesses have been cautious, if not outright reluctant, in adopting it on a broad scale. This sluggish uptake is, in part, due to the difficulty in finding partners and customers who are conversant with, and willing to adopt, this cutting-edge technology.\n\nFinally, there’s Regulation. The dynamic nature of the regulatory environment surrounding blockchain only amplifies the complexities. For businesses, the continual evolution of regulations presents a moving target, making it exceptionally challenging to stay compliant while navigating through this fluid legal landscape.\n\nSolutions\n\nAlbeit the challenges are formidable, let’s shift our lens towards the corresponding solutions. Indeed, the journey towards harnessing the full potential of blockchain requires navigation through choppy waters, but promising developments are underway.\n\nAddressing the Security concerns, we see blockchain developers tirelessly striving to bolster the security framework of blockchain projects. New security protocols are being conceived, robust tools are being crafted, and educational resources are being deployed to enlighten developers and users about best practices. The introduction of quantum-resistant algorithms, for example, is poised to fortify blockchain against quantum computing threats.\n\nThe Complexity conundrum is also being tackled head-on. Developers are striving to simplify the technology and make it more palatable to businesses. For instance, organisations like Chaincode Labs are investing in research and development to make blockchain technology more accessible and comprehensible.\n\nTo bolster Adoption, businesses have a pivotal role to play. The onus is on them to enlighten their clientele and associates about the potential benefits of blockchain technology. The establishment of consortiums, such as the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance with its impressive roster of Fortune 500 companies, has significantly driven up the adoption rate.\n\nWith regards to Regulation, an active collaboration between businesses and regulatory bodies could pave the way for lucid and consistent guidelines for blockchain projects. This harmony will serve to demystify the compliance landscape, providing a more predictable legal framework for businesses to operate within.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile blockchain is indeed a formidable tool, armed with the capacity to instigate significant transformations across various industries, its potential can only be harnessed if the aforementioned challenges are appropriately addressed.\n\nIn addition to the discussed hurdles, other contributing factors may potentially hinder blockchain’s success. The lack of a defined use case poses a significant challenge, as it obstructs businesses from ascertaining the industries or applications that could maximise the benefits of blockchain. The absence of a clearly articulated use case makes it arduous to rationalise the investment in this nascent technology.\n\nThe prohibitive costs associated with blockchain development also pose a formidable barrier. Given the complexity of the technology, its development is inherently expensive, thereby posing a considerable financial challenge to small businesses and startups.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of interoperability between different blockchain platforms compounds the issue. With each platform employing diverse protocols and standards, the exchange of data or interaction between various blockchain systems becomes problematic.\n\nNevertheless, despite the daunting challenges, there is substantial cause for optimism. Blockchain technology possesses an inherent potential to address numerous real-world problems. A growing interest from businesses and governments worldwide further fuels this optimism. By acknowledging and addressing these challenges, we stand a chance at leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionise our world, truly capitalising on its disruptive potential. Thus, the future of blockchain, while not devoid of hurdles, holds a promise worth striving for.\n"

So, grab a seat and get ready to discover the secrets of harnessing ChatGPT like a pro!\n\nEasy Accessibility:\nBookmark the URL of ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) on your browser’s bookmarks bar for quick access.\nAfter logging in, right-click on the ChatGPT tab and pin it. This will keep the tab readily available, even if you keep opening and closing other tabs. \nOmnipresence:\nAlthough ChatGPT doesn’t have a mobile app, you can still use it in your mobile browser.\nAdd the ChatGPT page to your mobile home screen using the Chrome browser’s “Add to Home screen” menu option. This will provide you with the convenience of working with it like a mobile app. \nEnsure that you use the same login on both your computer and mobile device so that your old chats are accessible across all devices. ChatGPT remembers your chats, allowing you to extend conversations anytime, if you have access to your old chats.\nSqueaky clean account:\nTo keep your ChatGPT account organized, consider deleting small chats that have already served their purpose, regularly. Simply click on the chat topic in the left pane, select the bin icon, and confirm the deletion. This will help keep the list of topics in the left pane under control.\nLeverage of old chats:\nAs you engage more with ChatGPT, you’ll accumulate numerous interesting chats. Finding a particular chat might become challenging. Although ChatGPT doesn’t currently offer a search function, you can use your browser’s search function to locate specific chats. A simple Control+F” (or “Command+F on Mac) should do the job.\nIt’s helpful to label your chats appropriately. Although ChatGPT does a good job at it, ChatGPT also allows you to edit the labels. So, don’t hesitate to personalize the chat names to facilitate quick searching.\nCopying text across:\nWhen using ChatGPT, you’ll frequently find yourself copying text to and from the chat interface. Don’t worry about the size of the text you need to copy into ChatGPT, as the practical text limit is quite high, and you’re unlikely to encounter any limitations for most purposes.\nWhen copying text from ChatGPT, make sure to take advantage of the convenient copy button provided. Instead of struggling to highlight the correct text and then copying it, simply use the copy button provided within the interface. This feature saves you time and ensures that you can quickly and accurately capture the desired response.\nBy implementing these tips, you’ll be able to use ChatGPT more frequently and effectively. And I don’t have to tell you that the possibilities of what you can achieve with such usage are limitless!",

      "content": "Apple’s biggest event of the year, WWDC 2023, is just around the corner. Happening on June 5, this edition will be focused on both software and hardware, where the company is likely to demonstrate the features and capabilities of iOS 17, watchOS 10, and macOS 14 to the world.\n\nFurthermore, the company is also reported to unveil a plethora of hardware products, including its first mixed reality headset, a 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac Pro, and a lot more at its annual developers’ conference.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the prominent hardware products that could go official at WWDC 2023.\n\nApple’s AR/VR headset (RealityPro)\nApple’s seven years of hard work might finally come to fruition with the launch of its first mixed-reality headset at WWDC 2023. While the company has never really confirmed its existence in any way, a lot of leaks and speculations do hint towards Apple’s next big product — RealityPro.\n15-inch MacBook Air\nThe new 15-inch MacBook Air is likely to be another important hardware announcement that Apple could make at WWDC 2023. Since its origin, the MacBook Air has always been a small and compact notebook and is also one of the most popular Macs across the world, and Apple could finally showcase the biggest MacBook Air boasting a 15-inch screen at WWDC 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn terms of form factor, the 15-inch MacBook Air is said to resemble the current M2 MacBook Air and is likely to offer similar features and capabilities and is said to be powered by the same M2 processor. With a bigger display and possibly a slightly larger battery, the 15-inch MacBook Air is likely to offer more performance and battery life when compared to the current models, and it could also carry a slightly more expensive price tag.\n\nMac Studio SSD, Mac Studio upgradeable SSD, Apple Mac Studio, Mac Studio teardown suggests an upgradable SSD. (Image credit: Apple)\nMac Studio\nWhen Apple originally announced the Mac Studio, it took everyone by storm by offering desktop computer-like performance in a compact form factor. The upcoming Mac Studio is likely to take the performance envelope to the next level with M2 Max and M2 Ultra processors with up to 24 CPU cores, 60 GPU cores, and up to 192 GB of unified memory, which could easily make it the most popular mini-sized computer.\n\nAgain, in terms of form factor, the Mac Studio is likely to resemble its predecessors, with performance being the primary differentiator. Apple has even confirmed a trade-in program for the Mac Studio, which further indicates that the new Mac Studio is on its way.Mac Pro\nMac Pro is another ambitious product from Apple, and it is also the last Mac that is yet to receive an Apple Silicon makeover. Earlier reports suggested that Apple is working on an M2 Extreme chip. However, more recent reports indicate that the Mac Pro might feature an M2 Ultra processor. Unlike the Mac Studio with Apple Silicon, the Mac Pro is likely to get support for user-expandable storage and memory."

      "content": "It has been around 5 months since Google Play Store and App Store removed Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) from their apps listing. The digital app stores followed the orders of the Indian government, which imposed a soft ban on BGMI over alleged safety and privacy concerns. Since then, the gaming industry in India has been waiting for the ban to be lifted. From gamers to esports content creators, everyone is speculating on the possible return of BGMI. However, in a recent revelation, many gaming content creators have claimed that Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) will be unbanned at the start of 2023.\n\nAccording to gaming content creators of AFKGaming BGMI is returning to Android next month. In a recent live stream of Pratik \"Alpha Clasher\" Jogiya a player named 'predatorsasuke' claimed that he works at Google and shared the tentative relaunch date of BGMI. \"You'd be very happy, BGMI will launch on Google Play Store on 15th January; it is a tentative date,\" he said.\n\nLater in another livestream by player Sohail \"Hector\" Shaikh answered a question on possible return of BGMI and said \"The game is going to return in January. Someone from Google said this. I don't know this personally, but I have heard this.\"\n\nThat person is someone important in the Google community; he is someone in a leadership position. It doesn't matter if someone from the gaming community says that the game will return. That person said that the game would return on 15th January,\" he added. However, to verify the information, Hector asked everyone to give him time. He further assured that if the game came back, he would inform everyone about it two weeks prior.\nNotably, neither Krafton nor Google has confirmed or announced anything related to the comeback of BGMI. Since the ban of BGMI in July, Krafton has been continuously assuring players that the company is working with the government to bring back the game. However, no update or announcement has been made till date on the return of BGMI on app stores.\n\nEven in a conversation with India Today Tech, Krafton said that they are in constant talks with the Government for the game. No other update has been officially shared yet. As for January, we are not sure about BGMI, but Krafton does have something else ready for players. The BGMI and PUBG Mobile maker Krafton has confirmed two new games for the Indian market. During our recent visit to the company's office in Seoul, South Korea, Krafton announced that they are planning to launch two games -- The Callisto Protocol and Defense Derby early next year."
